## Description
I built Grab Back during my time as a Software Engineering Fellow at Hackbright Academy (March 2017 - June 2017). The app visualizes women’s representation in the labor force delineated by congressional district. Users can explore women's overall representation in the labor force or in management positions. A side chart displays the five districts that have the highest or the lowest representation of women in the category currently displayed on the map.

Users can view data for the percentage of women who make up the general labor force or management positions. A key displays which shades of blue represent which values. By default, the side-chart shows the 5 congressional districts that have the highest representation of the group currently displayed on the map and these districts are compared with the U.S. representation.

<br>

<kbd>![Change Categories](/static/gif/grabBack_toggleLowest.gif)</kbd>

Users can also update the side-chart to view the five districts with the lowest representation of women in each category. 

<br>

<kbd>![Historical](/static/gif/grabBack_scrollYear.gif)</kbd>

The scroll bar updates the map and chart to display historical data.

<br>


<kbd>![Zipcode](/static/gif/grabBack_zipSearch.gif)</kbd>

Query for a congressional district by zipcode to update the side-chart to show the rate of employment of women in that zip-code's congressional district, the zip-code's state, and the U.S. as a whole.

For the tiny districts out East, the user can zoom-in by clicking on a particular district, pan by clicking on another district, and zoom-out by clicking the same district twice.

## <a name="improvements"></a>Future Plans & Improvements

* Add testing to code.
* Improve the interactivity of the map and chart, making changing categories of data or years more intuitive and easier to navigate.
* Add more historical data.
* Predict future data using predictive modeling.

Hi! My name is [Sasha Skinner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sashaskinner) and I am a software engineer. I began my training at Hackbright Academy’s full-time Software Engineering Fellowship, an engineering bootcamp for women in San Francisco (graduated: June 2017). 
 
Prior to Hackbright, I spent several as a research assistant cognitive neuroscience lab at UCSF investigating how technology based interventions affect cognition. I especially enjoyed working with MRI data and was fascinated by the process of transforming a raw dataset into something meaningful. Before UCSF, I conducted community health education and outreach with AmeriCorps. 
 
I am passionate about data analysis, social justice, and improving healthcare and I believe that technology plays a critical role technology in advancing all of these fields. My goal as a software engineer is to make meaningful contributions to these fields while engaging my love of problem solving. If you have a role that you think that I would be a good fit for, please feel free to email sasha.skinner at gmail.
